            <b>Pricing, Payments and Refund Policy for online premium subscriptions:</b><br>
            <b>1.Pricing and Payments:</b><br>
            You can purchase a premium subscription service of your choice for any category(ies) of services/content by following instructions on the Website(s)/Mobile Application(s) and making the payment applicable for the premium subscription you intend to purchase.<br><br>

            Please read the below terms applicable for the purchase of your platform premium subscription. The below terms are to be read with any other terms communicated to you at the time of purchase of your premium subscription:<br><br>

            You agree to pay all premium subscription fees and charges that are attributable to your account on the platform and that you are solely responsible for payment of these fees and charges. The premium subscriptions are payable in full and in advance and are valid until the completion of the applicable Subscription Period or until otherwise cancelled or terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.<br><br>

            If you have specifically authorized us, then the payments for the applicable premium subscriptions are automatically charged at the beginning of each billing period, unless you withdraw your authorization or submit a cancellation request to us directly through your account prior to the start of the billing period or in writing via email to the email address support@crex.live. The payment for your applicable premium subscription will be charged upon the anniversary of its billing period if the payments for applicable premium subscription are in more than a single tranche. Subject to your specific authorization and applicable laws, you agree that PARTH may charge any recurring service to the credit card or debit card or account that you provide/link at the time of your first purchase of the applicable premium subscription or as updated by you through your account on the Platform, provided such updation takes place prior to upcoming billing period.<br><br>

            If you have not completed payments for your applicable premium subscriptions, we may restrict / suspend your access to the Platform until your account becomes current and paid in full.<br><br>

            We reserve the right to pursue the fee owed to us using collection methods which may include charging other payment methods on file with us and/or retaining collection agencies or legal counsel.<br><br>

            Your payments to PARTH shall be subject to applicable taxes including without limitation Goods and Service Taxes (GST) or other similar taxes as may be applicable in your country of residence/from where you have created your account on the Platform/ purchased the underlying premium subscriptions.<br><br>

            We reserve the right to change/revise the pricing of the premium subscriptions. For existing Subscriptions for which the applicable fees have been already received by us, we will implement the price changes during the next billing period or renewal of the premium subscription.<br><br>

            We further reserve the right to offer custom plans and pricing (including discounts and / or special offers) in addition to what is offered on the Platform, which include offering custom billing and payment terms, that are different from our standard terms.<br><br>

            We use third-party payment gateways and/or aggregators to process payments applicable to the Services offered by us. Third-party payment gateway(s) made available to you may vary depending on the premium subscription you choose. Similarly, we have also enabled integration of third-party payment providers to facilitate better payment options to you, which may vary depending on your territory or the premium subscription you choose. Third-party payment gateways/aggregators and third- party payment providers shall collectively be referred to as “Third-Party Service Providers”.<br><br>

            Third-Party Service Providers may also charge you fees to use or access their services and may require your Personal Information to complete any transaction for the Platform. Further, to facilitate completion of your payments to us through the Platform or avail the payment options provided to you, you may be redirected to an external website operated by the Third-Party Service Provider. We cannot and do not (i) guarantee the adequacy of the privacy and security practices employed by or the content and media provided by the Third-Party Service Provider or its respective websites or (ii) control collection or use of your Personal Information by such Third-Party Service Provider. Hence, prior to using any services offered by a Third-Party Service Provider, we suggest that you read their terms and conditions, privacy policy and other policies, that may apply, to understand their terms of usage and to understand how your Personal information is being processed. PARTH is not affiliated to any Third-Party Service Provider and neither PARTH nor any of the Third-Party Service Provider are agents or employees of the other.<br><br>

            Further, pursuant to the payment option you may choose, you may be required to enter into a separate agreement with the relevant Third-Party Service Provider. This agreement with the Third-Party Service Provider is an independent contract/agreement between you and such Third-Party Service Provider and PARTH shall in no manner be a party to the same. PARTH is only facilitating various payment options to you and is not offering the payment by itself in any manner.<br><br>

            You agree that you are solely responsible for all charges that occur through such Third-Party Service Providers and acknowledge and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PARTH, its licensors, their affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from any loss arising out of or related to the use of the Platform or any purchases made through the Platform. This obligation will survive your use of the Platform and termination of your Agreement with us. For purposes of the Platform Terms, “Loss” means all losses, liabilities, damages, awards, settlements, claims, suits, proceedings, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements and costs of investigation, litigation, settlement, judgment, interest, and penalties). PARTH shall not be liable to you for any claims arising out of any act or omission on the part of the Third-Party Service Provider(s) including, but not limited to, any lost, stolen, or incorrectly processed payments. PARTH expressly disclaims any responsibility and liability for all services provided by the Third-Party Service Provider(s).<br><br>

            Please note that all subscription payments are collected by PARTH only through the Platform and not through any third parties (except Third-Party Service Provider(s)). We do not usually authorize any third party (except Third-Party Service Provider(s)) to collect monies on our behalf; however, if we have authorized any third party then such third party will have received a written authorization from PARTH either by way of any agreement or an authorization letter. Kindly verify with such third party before you make any payments to them, alternatively, you can always check with us by writing to us at email address support@crex.live. Further, PARTH is solely authorized to offer discounts / offers, if any, on the subscription prices. These discounts / offers are communicated on the Platform or via direct communication to you from PARTH via email, SMS, phone, or such other means of communication, and can be availed only through the Platform, unless otherwise specifically communicated by PARTH. Other than PARTH, no person, including without limitation, any third-party platform, are allowed to offer any discounts on the subscription prices offered on the Platform. PARTH shall not be liable for any claims arising from such unauthorized discounts / offers offered by any person (including any third- party platform), other than PARTH.<br><br>

            <b>2.Cancellation and Refund Policy:<br><br></b>
            You may cancel your Subscription through your account on the Platform. However, please note that the cancellation will become effective at the end of the then-current billing period; in other words, we will not renew your premium subscription, but the existing subscription will continue until the end of its billing period and there shall be no refund of the fee already paid for the same, unless otherwise specified in the Refund Policy. So, please read these terms and conditions and the Refund Policy carefully before purchasing any subscription plans, as once you have subscribed, you cannot change or cancel your subscription plan. Once you subscribe and make the required payment for any online subscriptions, it shall be final and there cannot be any changes or modifications to the same and neither will there be any refund.<br><br>

            When you cancel your Subscription, PARTH may disable access to features made available to you upon your purchase of Subscription, while your account may continue to exist on the Platform.<br><br>
